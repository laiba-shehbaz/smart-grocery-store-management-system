## 🛒 Overview

The store owner needs to keep records of **products, prices, available stock and sales**.
This program does that with plain Python: **lists of dictionaries** for storage, **loops** to process records, **conditionals** to choose operations and **custom functions** to keep the code organised.

It runs from a menu and keeps running until the user chooses **Exit**.

> 💡 **Design goal:** simple, easy-to-read logic. No classes, no files, no external libraries, only the basics of an introductory Python course.

## ✨ Features at a Glance

| # | Feature | What it does |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | ➕ **Add New Product** | Reads product details, blocks duplicate IDs, stores a dictionary with `.append()` |
| 2 | 📋 **View All Products** | Prints a table of ID, name, category, price and stock |
| 3 | 🔍 **Search Product** | Finds products by **ID** or **name** (case-insensitive, partial names work) |
| 4 | 📦 **Update Stock** | Adds stock to a product *or* sets an exact quantity, then shows the result |
| 5 | 💰 **Process Sale** | Checks product and stock, calculates total, deducts stock, prints a summary |
| 6 | 🧾 **View Sales Records** | Lists every completed sale |
| 7 | 📊 **Store Report** | Totals, revenue, low-stock items, highest and lowest priced products |
| 8 | 🚪 **Exit** | Ends the program politely |

## ▶️ How to Run

**Requirements:** Python 3.8 or newer. No extra packages.

```bash
# 1. Unzip the project and open the folder
cd smart_grocery_store

# 2. Run the program
python grocery_store.py          # on some systems: python3 grocery_store.py
```

The store starts with four sample products (Milk, Bread, Eggs, Rice) so every option can be tried immediately.

## 📝 Task-by-Task Description

### 1️⃣ Product Management
Products live in a list called `products`. Each product is a dictionary with the keys `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, `stock`.

### 2️⃣ Add New Products: `add_product()`
1. Asks for the **Product ID** first and checks the list with `find_product()`.
2. If the ID already exists, it prints *"This Product ID already exists"* and nothing is added.
3. Otherwise it asks for name, category, price and stock, builds a dictionary and adds it with `products.append(...)`.

### 3️⃣ Display All Products: `view_all_products()`
Loops through `products` and prints one aligned row per product. Shows *"No products available"* if the list is empty.

### 4️⃣ Search Products: `search_product()`
- Type a **number** → matches the product ID (only plain digits `0-9` count as a number).
- Type **text** → matches product names (upper/lower case ignored, part of a name is enough, e.g. `mil` finds *Milk*).
- Prints the **complete details** of every match, or *"Product not found"* if there is none.

### 5️⃣ Update Product Stock: `update_stock()`
Asks for a Product ID, then offers:
- **1. Add stock** → new stock = old stock + quantity entered
- **2. Set new stock quantity** → stock becomes the quantity entered (0 is allowed)

The updated stock is displayed afterwards. Any other choice leaves the stock unchanged.

### 6️⃣ Process a Customer Sale: `process_sale()`

| Step | Check / Action |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | Ask for Product ID → **does the product exist?** If not, the sale is cancelled |
| 2 | Ask for quantity (must be 1 or more) |
| 3 | **Is there enough stock?** If `quantity > stock` the sale is **refused** (stock stays unchanged) |
| 4 | Calculate `total = price × quantity` |
| 5 | Deduct the quantity from the stock |
| 6 | Save the sale in the `sales` list and print a **purchase summary** |

### 7️⃣ Store Sales Records: `view_sales_records()`
Every successful sale is saved as a dictionary in the separate `sales` list. Option 6 prints them all in a table.

### 8️⃣ Generate Store Report: `generate_report()`
Displays:
- Total number of products
- Total available stock (sum of all stock)
- Total sales transactions
- Total revenue generated
- Products with stock **below 5** units
- Product(s) with the **highest** price
- Product(s) with the **lowest** price

> If two products share the highest (or lowest) price, **both** are shown.

## 🗃️ Data Structures

**`products`**: list of dictionaries

```python
products = [
    {"id": 101, "name": "Milk", "category": "Dairy", "price": 250.0, "stock": 20},
]
```

**`sales`**: separate list of dictionaries

```python
sales = [
    {"product_id": 101, "product_name": "Milk", "quantity_sold": 4, "total_amount": 1000.0},
]
```

## 🧬 ER Diagram & Data Hierarchy

The program has two entities. **PRODUCT** is stored in the `products` list and **SALE** is stored in the `sales` list. One product can appear in many sales (**1 : N**), connected by the product ID.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/er-diagram.svg" alt="Entity-Relationship diagram" width="100%">
</div>

The same diagram in text form (GitHub renders it automatically):

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PRODUCT ||--o{ SALE : "is sold in"
    PRODUCT {
        int id PK "unique"
        string name
        string category
        float price
        int stock
    }
    SALE {
        int product_id FK
        string product_name
        int quantity_sold
        float total_amount
    }
```

**Data hierarchy (tree view)**

```text
GROCERY STORE (running program)
├── products  (list)
│   └── PRODUCT (dictionary)
│       ├── id        → int,   unique, ≥ 1
│       ├── name      → str,   not empty
│       ├── category  → str,   not empty

    └── SALE (dictionary)
        ├── product_id     → int  (links to PRODUCT.id)
        ├── product_name   → str
        ├── quantity_sold  → int, ≥ 1
        └── total_amount   → float (price × quantity)

## 🧠 Code Explanation & Function Hierarchy

`main()` shows the menu in a `while True` loop and uses `if / elif / else` to call the correct function. Choice `8` uses `break` to leave the loop.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/hierarchy.svg" alt="Function hierarchy" width="100%">
</div>

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `get_text(message)` | Repeats until the user types non-empty text |
| `get_whole_number(message, minimum)` | Repeats until the user types a whole number ≥ `minimum` |
| `get_price(message)` | Repeats until the user types a valid price greater than 0 |
| `find_product(product_id)` | Loops through `products`; returns the matching dictionary or `None` |
| `show_product(product)` | Prints all five fields of one product |
| `add_product()` | Option 1: adds a product, rejects duplicate IDs |
| `view_all_products()` | Option 2: prints all products in a table |
| `search_product()` | Option 3: search by ID or (partial) name |
| `update_stock()` | Option 4: add stock or set a new quantity |
| `process_sale()` | Option 5: validate, calculate total, deduct stock, record the sale |
| `view_sales_records()` | Option 6: prints every sale in a table |
| `generate_report()` | Option 7: totals, revenue, low stock, highest / lowest price |
| `show_menu()` | Prints the main menu |
| `main()` | Runs the program loop until Exit |

**Key idea:** dictionaries are accessed by key (`product["stock"]`), and because a product dictionary is shared, changing `product["stock"]` inside a function updates the real list. No copying is needed.

## 🛡️ Input Validation Rules

| Input | Rule | If invalid |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Menu choice | `1`-`8` | Error message, menu shown again |
| Product ID | Whole number ≥ 1, not already used (when adding) | Asks again / rejects duplicate |
| Name, Category | Not empty | Asks again |
| Price | Number > 0 (`nan` / `inf` rejected) | Asks again |
| Stock (new product / set) | Whole number ≥ 0 | Asks again |
| Quantity to add / sell | Whole number ≥ 1 | Asks again |
| Stock update choice | `1` or `2` | Error message, stock unchanged |
| Sale quantity | Must not exceed available stock | Sale cancelled with a clear message |
| Search text | Plain digits are treated as an ID, anything else as a name | Unknown text shows "Product not found" |
| `Ctrl + C` / end of input | n/a | Program closes politely (no crash) |

## 🖥️ Sample Run

Selling 4 Milk, then trying to sell more Eggs than available, then opening the report:

```text
--- Process Customer Sale ---
Enter Product ID: 101
Enter purchase quantity: 4

--- Purchase Summary ---
Product         : Milk (ID 101)
Unit Price      : 250.00
Quantity        : 4
Total Price     : 1000.00
Remaining Stock : 16

--- Process Customer Sale ---
Enter Product ID: 103
Enter purchase quantity: 10
Error: Only 4 unit(s) of Eggs in stock. Sale cancelled.

====================================
          STORE REPORT
====================================
Total number of products : 4
Total available stock    : 65
Total sales transactions : 1
Total revenue generated  : 1000.00

Products with stock below 5 units:
  - Eggs (ID 103): 4 left

Highest priced product : Rice (ID 104) - 450.00
Lowest priced product  : Bread (ID 102) - 120.00
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

An automated test file with **38 checks** is included. It feeds fake keyboard input to each function and verifies the printed result and the data. It covers:

- every input helper (empty text, letters, 0, negative, `nan`, `inf`)
- adding products and blocking duplicate IDs
- search by ID, full name, partial name, not-found and unicode digits like `²` (must not crash)
- adding stock, setting stock, invalid choice, unknown ID
- sale success, unknown product, insufficient stock, selling exactly all stock, out-of-stock item
- sales records, store report (with sales, without sales, price ties, empty store)
- menu: invalid choice, running an option, clean exit

Run it with:

```bash
python tests/test_grocery_store.py
```

Expected last line: `ALL 38 CHECKS PASSED`
